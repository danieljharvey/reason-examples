# Reason Examples
### Some helpful examples of how the standard library functions work as I don't think that's immediately clear.

So far I have started with some easy ones, [List](List.re), [Char](Char.re) and [String](String.re). 

It looks a bit messy in code so it may be necessary to also copy into a markdown file for ease on the eye.

If anybody else would like to join in this possibly ridiculous task, please get in touch or just brazenly submit a PR, I don't mind.
